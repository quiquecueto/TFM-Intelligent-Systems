# TFM-Intelligent-Systems
In this repository there is a Jupyter notebook file in which the code made for the Master's Final Project was made. In this notebook we load data from Hangzhou's (China) subway network and also weather data from the same city and use a Long Short Term Memory algorithm (LSTM) and Facebook's algorithm Prophet to compare which one produces the most accurate forcasting.

## Data Cleaning
There is a Data Cleaning process at the beggining of the Notebook after loading the datasets. In this section there are some cleaning, grouping and 

## LSTM
There are some LSTM models built in this part of the notebook. There are a total of 5 different scenarios, so there are 5 different models built in the LSTM section.

## Prophet
Same as LSTM, 5 scenarios but in this case we have 10 different models because there are 2 variables to predict and Prophet can only process one at a time.

## ARIMA, XGBoost, Random Forest
Arima is not implemented yet. XGBoost and Random Forest turned out to be not a good choice to forecast the data.
